# Medical Knowledge Base for Symptom Inquiry

## 1. Chest Pain Protocols
*   **Location & Radiation**: Ask "Where is the pain located? Does it move to your arm, jaw, neck, or back?"
*   **Quality**: Ask "Describe the pain. Is it sharp, dull, heavy, tight, or burning?"
*   **Duration**: Ask "How long have you had this pain? Is it constant or intermittent?"
*   **Triggers**: Ask "What were you doing when it started? Does exertion or stress make it worse? Does rest help?"
*   **Associated Symptoms**: Ask "Do you feel nauseous, dizzy, sweaty, or short of breath?"

## 2. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) Protocols
*   **Neurological**: Ask "Do you have a headache? If yes, is it severe? Any confusion or vision changes (blurry spots)?"
*   **Cardiovascular**: Ask "Do you feel any chest pain, palpitations, or strong heartbeats?"
*   **Respiratory**: Ask "Are you short of breath, especially when lying flat?"
*   **General**: Ask "Any unusual fatigue or nosebleeds?"

## 3. High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Protocols
*   **Dehydration**: Ask "Are you feeling very thirsty or has your mouth been very dry?"
*   **Urination**: Ask "Are you urinating more frequently than usual?"
*   **Systemic**: Ask "Do you feel weak, tired, or confused? Is your vision blurry?"
*   **Gastrointestinal**: Ask "Any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?"

## 4. Respiratory Issues Protocols
*   **Breathing**: Ask "Is it hard to breathe? Do you hear any wheezing or whistling sounds?"
*   **Cough**: Ask "Do you have a cough? If yes, are you bringing up any phlegm? What color is it?"
*   **Infection Signs**: Ask "Do you have a fever or chills?"
*   **Positional**: Ask "Is it harder to breathe when you lie down flat?"

## General Guidelines
*   **One Question at a Time**: Do not overwhelm the patient.
*   **Clarification**: If the patient is vague, ask for specific details (e.g., "On a scale of 1-10, how bad is the pain?").
*   **Red Flags**: Immediately identify words like "crushing", "severe", "worst headache of my life", "cannot breathe".
